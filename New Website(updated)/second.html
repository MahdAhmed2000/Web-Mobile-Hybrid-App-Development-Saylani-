     <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12"
       <p class="lead">The year was 1995, when Unisport first saw the light of day in the little football-country, Denmark. The company kicked off in a small flat in Copenhagen by entrepreneur, and huge Tottenham fan, Henrik Larsen.<br>

After just six months in the initial flat, an opportunity to move to a larger location on Istedgade came along. Back then we could already offer football shirts from all over the world, which was our great passion. The store would attract people from all over the world, eager to explore our huge assortment of football shirts.</p>

     <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12"
       <p class="lead">After just six months on Istedgade, we had outgrown the location, and it was time to relocate once again. This time the destination would be Vesterbrogade 45.<br>

The bar was raised yet again as the store in Vesterbrogade was expanded to include an extra floor. The first Nike Football shop-in-shop in Denmark became a reality, and the expansion gave us the opportunity to complete the football experience by also offering football boots. This made us dream big, and sparked the dream of becoming one of the best in Europe.</p>

     <h1 class="display-4">Starting the online adventure</h1>
     <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12"
       <p class="lead">In 2002 we decided to start selling our football products online, and our first website unisport.dk was launched. The online business had a rather slow start, but the 2004 European Championships enabled us to slowly but surely increase the number of customers.<br>

In the mid 00's e-commerce was really exploding, and in the summer of 2006, we relocated our office to Vesterbrogade 15 and 17. The physical store also got new home grounds right across the main entrance of the famous Tivoli in Copenhagen.<br>

An increasing number of employees, and brand new positions were born. Innovation was key, and the now famous Unisport WebTV concept was launched. Our very own WebTV channel, where football boot reviews, interviews with footballers and product videos were uploaded. Last but not least, a small team was put together to produce daily blogs on the latest football gear. Everything in order to offer more value for our users, and provide the knowledge needed for a proper football shopping experience.</p>

     <h1 class="display-4">Award winning e-commerce</h1>
     <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12"
       <p class="lead">We have won the user award three times – in 2011, 2012 and 2017. The user award goes to the company that receives the most votes from consumers, and then gets the best results from a Best Practice Review conducted by a jury. We won the Social Commerce award in 2012, as a result of our work in relation to combining e-commerce and social media.<br>

In 2013 we won both the B2C award and the E-commerce Gold as the best Web shop in Denmark. As a result of the latter we went to defend the honour of Denmark on the big international scene. Among the biggest and best we were awarded European bronze, and took the third spot in the rank of the best web shops in Europe.<br>

In 2014, we made our way into the spotlight again when winning the Cross Border award. An achievement that we repeated in 2016. The same year as we also won the best webshop in Sweden, and placed in Top 3 webshops in Norway. A proof that our concept can stand the distance in other countries. Every awards is a great recognition of our team, who all work very hard to make a difference.</p>
